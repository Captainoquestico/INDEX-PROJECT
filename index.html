        <h2>What are we about?</h2>
        <p>
          We offer programs to teach you how to code. To date, we have helped
          over 500 people from all walks of life to get hands-on experience in
          the tech sector. We are the only organisation in Nigeria with this
          specific focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand how difficult it can be to get into tech, so we provide
          a mentoring program that will guide you through the process of getting
          your first job, and offer continued mentorship support for as long as
          you need it.
